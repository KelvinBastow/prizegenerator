# Account Number and Prize Generator

My is to build an application that genorates a random number and letter that is then outputted to create a prize. The application will be set-up using varied technologies such as docker, jenkins and flask.

# Requirments

The requirements set for the project are below.
Note that these are a minimum set of requirements and can be added onto during the duration of the project.
The requirements of the project are as follows:

- An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
- An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
- If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
- The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
- The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
- As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
- The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.

You should consider the concept of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as you plan your project, complete all the requirements before you add extra functionality that is not specified above.
