# This service will also create an “Object” however this “Object” must be based upon the results of service 
# #2 + #3 using some pre-defined rules. Please see below for an example of how this logic can look.

# The complexity of your logic here is up to you, again a simple implementation is allowed, 
# however, may not showcase your full understanding of the technology.

# A prize generator with 2 different implementations available, 
#in both cases the prize is determined by the char string and number generated above.

# One for when the service is feeling generous (bigger rewards)
# One for when the service is not feeling generous (smaller rewards)
